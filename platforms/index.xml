      <description>The Arduino Uno is a popular platform for &amp;ldquo;physical computing&amp;rdquo; and first steps in embedded computing. It is based on an 8-bit Atmega microcontroller and ships with a powerful hardware abstraction library. Currently, the Mita Arduino Uno platform supports basic functionality, namely working with buttons and GPIO pins.
Sensor: button_one (Button) Modalities    Name Description     is_pressed : bool True if the button is pressed in this very right moment.</description>
